# [How to Rename a Database in MySQL](https://chartio.com/resources/tutorials/how-to-rename-a-database-in-mysql/)

## I prefer

1. In Phpmyadmin.
2. The [Dumping and Reimporting approach](https://chartio.com/resources/tutorials/how-to-rename-a-database-in-mysql/#dumping-and-reimporting)

Which means - import into the new desired database and drop the old one.
